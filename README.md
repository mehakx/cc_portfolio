 Self-Love Monitor: 

A simple, interactive self-assessment tool built using p5.hs to help users track their emotional well-being .

Project Overview

- The Self-Love Monitor** is a 4-step experience that encourages users to reflect on their current state of mind. It uses minimalist UI and an emotionally intentional design to feel calm, gentle, and welcoming.

Goals
- Help users reflect on emotions like energy, joy, peace, and more.
- Use interactive sliders to make the reflection feel active and tactile.
- Maintain user progress using local storage so users can pick up where they left off.

 Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS** — For structure and styling  
- p5.js — For dynamic UI and slider interactions  
- JavaScript— For logic, user flow, and local storage

Design Inspiration
Inspired by apps like **Pause** and **Reflectly**, this monitor uses soft shadows, pastel gradients, and a font like poppins, to create a warm and friendly interface. The goal was to make emotional check-ins feel less clinical and more like self-care.

Features:
- Save and load progress with local storage.
- Range sliders for emotional metrics
- Stylish UI with a cozy vibe (Zendaya would approve)

Challenges Faced:
- Styling p5.js-generated elements with external CSS
- Syncing slider values and text updates in real time
- Making the UI responsive across devices
- And learning new p5 elements like the Benzier Curve.
