    <h1>Reflection of this class:</h1>
    <p>I learnt alot in this class. It really made me push myself and scour the areas of code. P5 was challenging for me, as I had never learnt to code formally
        and hence trying to code without the use of AI was difficult, but it was also an eye-opener to the tech world, and how fascinating it is to merge both code and design in unique ways. 
        I learnt o approach problems strategically and break them down into smaller adressable bits. Overall, I look forward to exploring more areas in code especially in regards to VSC Code.
